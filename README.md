# CutsceneSkip

Exactly what it says on the tin.

A [Bomb Rush Cyberfunk](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1353230/Bomb_Rush_Cyberfunk/) mod that allows you to skip any cutscene in the game.

Built for [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases).

Skipping certain cutscenes *might* break things. Not tested very well, use at your own risk and **backup your save(s), just in case!**
